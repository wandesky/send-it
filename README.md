### The app
SendIT is a courier service that helps users deliver parcels to different destinations.   
This repository holds [@wandesky's](https://github.com/wandesky) submission of for Andela's Developer Challenge.  
### The develop branch
The [develop branch](https://github.com/wandesky/send-it-adc/tree/develop) houses a reasonably stable version of the app.  
When stability is ascertained and version 1 approved, then the changes will be merged to `master`.  
An interesting branch by the name [pipeline](https://github.com/wandesky/send-it-adc/tree/pipeline) is where the unstable, 'unapproved' and unverified changes are housed.  
To clone the repo, run `git clone https://github.com/wandesky/send-it-adc.git`  
Then switch to the develop branch to access the latest _working_ changes. You can do this using `git checkout develop`
